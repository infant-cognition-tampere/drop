## What is drop?

drop is an open-source platform for projects that aim to a present a task on computer screen and collect time-locked data from sensors during the task. drop was born from the need to collect data from multiple sensors synchronously during psychology research and to share experiments between testing sites and colleagues. drop is designed to be open source and modular platform to easily add new modules such as recording devices. It has been programmed on python.
