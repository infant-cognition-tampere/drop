Install Drop on clean Ubuntu or Linux Mint
==========================================

You can pretty easily install Drop into new computer that is being used in
research by simply running:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infant-cognition-tampere/drop/master/install-on-ubuntu.sh | bash -

However, generally speaking, this is slightly insecure practice and it is
recommended that you always check the contents of the shell script before doing
so.
